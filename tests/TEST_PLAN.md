# Home Assistant MCP Test Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the Home Assistant MCP project, ensuring all components work reliably both individually and together.

## Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing how components work together
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Testing complete workflows from user input to final output
4. **Performance Tests**: Testing system performance under various conditions
5. **Error Handling Tests**: Testing system behavior with invalid inputs and error conditions

## Current Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (Existing)

- **Connection Module**: API, Entity Manager, Utils
- **YAML Generator**: Dashboard, Dashboard Factory, Template Manager
- **Testing Module**: Validator
- **Automation Module**: Generator
- **Claude Integration**: Tools, MCP Interface

### Integration Tests (To Implement)

- **Connection + YAML Generator**: Test API data flowing into dashboard generation
- **Automation + Testing**: Test automation generation and validation workflows
- **Claude Integration + All Modules**: Test MCP interface with all underlying modules

### End-to-End Tests (To Implement)

- **Entity Control Workflow**: From MCP request to Home Assistant API call and response
- **Dashboard Creation Workflow**: From MCP request to YAML generation and validation
- **Automation Management Workflow**: From MCP request to automation creation and testing

## Test Priorities

1. **Critical Path Tests**: Entity control, dashboard creation, automation management
2. **Error Recovery Tests**: System behavior under error conditions
3. **Performance Under Load**: System behavior with many entities/automations
4. **Edge Cases**: Handling of special characters, large configurations, etc.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create integration test fixtures and mocks
2. Implement integration tests for each module combination
3. Create end-to-end test scenarios
4. Implement performance tests
5. Document test coverage and results

## Success Criteria

- All unit tests pass with 90%+ code coverage
- All integration tests pass, demonstrating proper component interaction
- End-to-end tests successfully complete critical workflows
- System performs adequately under expected load conditions
- System gracefully handles error conditions and invalid inputs
